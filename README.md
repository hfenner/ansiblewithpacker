# ansiblewithpacker
If you're reaching for an Ansible module to get information for your playbook, you're probably doing it wrong. If you find yourself wishing for nested loops on tasks to extract variables, you're probably doing it wrong. If you are creating static inventory files to list your hosts, you might be doing it right. Unless you're not using those inventory files to create the hosts you're listing. Because then you're probably doing it wrong.  It's okay to use Ansible in a way that works for you. However, there are a lot of powerful options that can make your code more maintainable, easier to collaborate on, and faster to write. Come learn about how to leverage dynamic inventories to get automated host listing, lookups to pull in real-time data, and Jinja2 filters to pare that huge list of facts down to a the list of IP addresses you actually need. We'll be using an Ansible to create and deploy a Packer configuration file that builds several VM's including a CentOS and Vyos system.
